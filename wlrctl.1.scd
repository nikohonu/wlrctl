# TOPLEVEL MATCHSPEC

A match is a colon separated attribute/value pair. e.g. To match a firefox
window, a suitable match value is _app\_id:firefox_. You may give any number of
match specifiers, and a window must match all of them to be considered. If the
app\_id or title keys are specified more than once, a window may match any of
the given values. Otherwise later key value pairs override previous ones. A
match without a key is assumed to be an app_id, so just _firefox_ works in the
example above.

Currently supported attributes are: _app_id_, _title_, and _state_.

Supported state values are: _maximized_, _minimized_, _active_, and
_fullscreen_, and their negations: _unmaximized_, _unminimized_, _inactive_,
and _unfullscreen_.  You can also use a '-' prefix, for example
_state:-fullscreen_.
